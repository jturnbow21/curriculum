# Day 01

- what is react and why was it made
  - don't have to worry about refreshing page, or how to do that efficiently
  - just focus on the data you are capturing and how you want the page to look based on that state
  - great developer experience
- using create-react-app to start a new project from scratch
  - `npx create-react-app my-app`
- simple static site in react, with multiple components
  - App.jsx
    - Header.jsx
    - Body.jsx
      - GarageSale.jsx
        - GarageSaleItem.jsx
- we will be using hooks only, and will be ignoring class based components
