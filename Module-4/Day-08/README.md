# Day 8

- working group session to continue building out the weather app
- deploy it!

ideas for weather app:

- make it look really good
- use the user's location to set the weather query: https://dev.to/codebucks/how-to-get-user-s-location-in-react-js-1691
- display the image provided for the weather description (e.g sunny, cloudy image)
