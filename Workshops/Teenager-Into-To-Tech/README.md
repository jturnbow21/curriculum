# Intro to tech for teenagers

## Intro

I'm Zach and am so excited to be talking with you all about a career and vocation that is highly rewarding, fun, and creative. One where ideas you have can quickly be prototyped and provided to others. I have been a coder/programmer/software engineer/developer for a decade and have been teaching people to code for ~8 years. A coder works on the software that runs the world. We have a lot to cover, but before I dive in, I'd love to hear from each of you, a few things:

- what do you think of when you hear the term "tech"
- what are some of your favorite apps/websites/web-apps

- pick out a few of the mentioned tech items, and ask them about what they think goes into making them, what sort of backgrounds are involved? How many people?

## Roles in tech

- not just coders. Other roles: Product, Project, Data analysis, QA, UI/UX, Accessability
- for example: roles in making a todo app
  - ui/ux designer that decides how it should look, and the flow users would go through (designs this in software made for this)
    - open page, all todos are listed
    - radio button to toggle between active and completed
    - create new todo button
    - delete todo button
    - complete todo button
  - front-end developer that codes this functionality
  - back-end developer that makes the api and database, which saves and make it available across all your devices

## Thinking like a programmer

- your role is to instruct a computer to do a specific task. Complex tasks can be broken down into simple steps, and that is what we typically call an algorithm
- Computers are not like human brains, and have limited information available. If you need information in order to make a decision for an algorithm, you must instruct the computer to gain that information in simple steps. Let's do an example:

  - sorting a list is a very common algorithm in programming, for example you may have a list of birthdays, and need to sort them by date in order to have a list of people under or over 18 perhaps.
  - for a computer, we can compare numbers, loop through lists, and create new lists
  - let's do an analogous example with the length of ropes:
    - I will give you a bundle of ropes, without looking, sort them from shortest to longest.
    - can you describe the algorithm you used to do this?
    - how many comparisons did you do? e.g how complex is your algorithm?

- Most developers don't concern themselves with simple examples like this, let's take a recent real world example:

## The story of Wordle

- made in one weekend, sold to nyt for a million dollars
- 5x6 grid
- new word each day
- after each guess find out if: correct letter in correct spot, correct letter not in correct spot, letter not in word
- imagine you have two words, and you need to find the answers to the above questions? Can you define an algorithm for doing so? Think about having two words in scrabble form in front of you. At the end you need to know for each letter, if it was correct, and whether it was in the correct position.

## Skills needed for tech

- not math and science
- what kind of things can you work on in tech
- why should you want to work in tech
- how you can get into tech
  - bootcamps
  - free online courses
  - university
- how I got into tech

## For blind or low vision students

- coding is blind/low vision accessible
- lots of tools out there that keep getting better
- lots of problems do not require vision
- whole field in web called accessibility
